My name is Jonalyn Bajar, I am 20 years old and I live in Barangay San Luis, Sitio Balite. I love dancing, especially when I feel bored, and I also enjoy singing. My favorite sport is volleyball. As a BSIT student, I believe that balancing my hobbies and studies helps me become more productive and motivated in reaching my goals.
